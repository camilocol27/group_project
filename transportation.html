			<h1>Why is it importance to drive an electric vehicle?</h1>

			<p class="main">Increasing transportation efficiency is the best place to start efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a primary culprit in global warming. Of all CO2 emissions in the United States, about 33 percent comes from transportation.
			Our electric vs. internal combustion engine chart shows the overwhelming advantages of electric cars — plug-in hybrid vehicles and all-electric vehicles (EVs) — over gasoline vehicles. With gasoline-electric hybrid power and all-electric power, we can achieve significant cost and environmental savings. By adding more batteries and recharging capability to gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, we can have plug-in hybrids that offer the range of hybrids (500 miles or more), plus the benefit of all-electric power for short trips, which dramatically reduces the amount of gasoline used. EVs require no gasoline whatsoever and, when recharged from renewable energy sources, produce zero total emissions.
			In fact, even if we switched from gasoline cars to EVs and plug-in hybrids recharged by our existing utility grids (which mostly use fossil fuels), we would see a 42 percent national average reduction in CO2 emissions, according to research by Peter Lilienthal of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
			As we approach the peak of world oil extraction and witness the consequences of climate change, it is important to reflect on how the world’s most technologically advanced nation came to base its economy on the use of polluting, finite resources. It is also important to recognize that corporations exist, for the most part, for one reason: to make money. This gives us, the consumer, and the ultimate power to shape corporate behavior through how we spend our money.

			<h2>Green era no more carbon dioxide </h2>

				<p>We are witnessing the launch of a new era of more fuel-efficient, less-polluting vehicles powered by technologies that aren't always familiar. If you're considering buying one of the new vehicles, you may well be concerned not only with how it handles but with how well it will hold up over time, what it might cost to maintain and if it really will be as good for the environment (and your wallet) as claimed. Fortunately, with a little information, the brave new world of greener alternative fuels and drivetrains is easy to grasp.
				Use the overview below and the accompanying new vehicle slideshows to guide your purchasing decisions as you look for the best car that suits your needs.</p>

			<h2 class ="hybird">Hybrid Cars</h2>
				
				<p>Hybrid gas-electric cars, which have been on U.S. roads for more than a decade, really aren't that complicated. Add an electric motor and rechargeable batteries to the conventional gas engine and see your efficiency increase by as much as 50 percent, with similar levels of reduction in emissions.
				Due to the cost of the batteries and other systems, hybrids tend to cost a little more than conventional cars, but the so-called hybrid premium is constantly coming down. For high-MPG hybrids, most studies show that you'll recoup the extra cost during the course of ownership. The number of hybrid choices will grow to 55 models in the next five years.</p>

			<h2 class="plug">Plug-in Hybrid Cars</h2>
				
				<p>A plug-in hybrid car is similar to a conventional hybrid vehicle -- both use a gasoline engine as well as an electric motor. However, a plug-in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity. Plug-in hybrids can be driven for long distances -- from a few miles to as much as 40 miles -- without using any gasoline. The Chevy Volt is the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid, but more models are on the way from Toyota, Ford, Hyundai and others.
				Plug-in hybrids have many of the benefits of electric cars, without the biggest drawback: limited driving range. When the juice runs out of the battery in a plug-in hybrid, it's no problem. The car will drive just like a conventional hybrid, until your next opportunity to plug in.</p>

			<h2 class="elec-vehicles">Electric Vehicles</h2>
				
				<p>Unlike a hybrid car -- which is fueled by gasoline and uses a battery and motor to improve efficiency -- an electric car is powered exclusively by electricity. Electric cars produce no tailpipe emissions, reduce our dependency on oil, and are cheaper to operate.
				EVs have fewer moving parts and systems and therefore have lower maintenance costs. They also come with generous warranties to provide consumers maximum comfort with adopting unfamiliar technology.
				Of course, the process of producing the electricity moves the emissions further upstream to the utility company's smokestack. Yet on average electricity can cut carbon pollution to half that released by a gas-powered car -- even less in areas with cleaner generation, though more in areas that rely more on dirty coal power plants.
				Besides driving range -- which can vary between 60 and 120 miles -- the biggest concern with electric cars these days is cost. The purchase price of electric cars can run quite a bit higher than similar conventional cars, but between generous government incentives, fewer maintenance costs, and the lower cost per mile for electricity compared to gasoline, the new breed of electric cars have a lower cost of ownership. Remember: no tailpipe emissions and no trips to the gas station.</p>
