				<h3>Recycling is Simple, Resourceful, and Tremendously Impactful</h3>
				<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle is the motto that holds true meaning. The world would be a better place if everyone could adapt a very simple concept that in actuality boils down to utilizing two bins: one for trash and another for recycling.
				</p>
				<p>It's remarkable how much waste is accumulated when a corporation, business, or household doesn't support recycling.</p>
				<p>Recycling contributes to a more healthy environment as it: protects and preserves natural wildlife habitats, saves energy, prevents contamination of water, and keeps trees and naural resources healthy.</p>
